# TYPO3 - Better API

Have you ever wondered why everything in TYPO3 seems so hard to do? Why must you register your plugin in five different files? Why you have to work with
TypoScript, Yaml, and XML, if you have the power of PHP and OOP at your disposal?

Well, ask no longer because this package aims to lessen the load on a developer by creating a streamlined, extendable API you can use to configure your TYPO3
installation and extensions. It also provides a variety of extended core functionality ready for you to use and says a final goodbye to defining your TCA using
Arrays.

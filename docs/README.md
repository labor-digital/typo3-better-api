# TYPO3 - Better API
Have you ever wondered why everything in TYPO3 seems so hard to do? Why you must register your plugin in five different files,
why you have to work with typoscript, yaml and xml when you are having the power of PHP and OOP at your disposal?

Well, ask no longer because this package aims to lessen the load on a developer by creating a streamlined,
extendable API you can use to configure your TYPO3 installation and extensions. It also provides a variety of extended 
core functionality ready for you to use and says a final goodbye to defining your TCA using Arrays.

::: warning
This package is freshly released to the public so I'm working on a nice documentation.
However, this will take a few weeks until I have something substantial. Bear with me, please.
